This is a set of ansible playbooks for managing my home infrastructure.

## Playbooks

To run a playbook, use `ansible-playbook <playbook.yaml>`.

### Speakers (*speakers.yaml*)

The speaker systems are Raspberry Pi Zeros with HiFiBerry Amp2+ HATs connected to
in-ceiling speakers. They run [raspotify](https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify) to
expose them to Spotify Connect and [snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) for
multi-room audio.

### Smart Mirror (*mirror.yaml*)

The smart mirror is a Raspberry Pi 4B (although a 3B works as well) connected to a
screen via HDMI. It runs [looking glass](https://github.com/glasslabs/looking-glass)
configured with my [config](https://github.com/nrwiersma/looking-glass-config).

### Home Lab Cluster (*cluster.yaml*)

The Home Lab is a Super6C fully loaded, running [k3s](https://k3s.io/), 
[metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/) and cron for DB backups.

#### Storage Drives

The storage NVME drives are each 4TB. In order to see the entire drive, they must be converted to a Hybrid Partition Table.
Boot the system using an external drive, and run the `.setup/mbr2gpt` to convert the partition table.
